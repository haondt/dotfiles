# Sticky

Sticky allows you to "stick" buffers into a numbered slot, and jump to that buffer instantly.

Heavily inspired by [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon), but instead of navigating
an arbitrarily sized list of targets, this is a fixed number of slots, and buffers must be
explicitly mapped to a given slot. I find this to be similar to setting your loadout and keybinds
for a video game, which is a better mental model for me.

Configuration options:

- `config.borderchars`
- `config.width`
- `config.height`

Highlight options:

- `StickyWindow`
- `StickyTitle`
- `StickyBorder`
